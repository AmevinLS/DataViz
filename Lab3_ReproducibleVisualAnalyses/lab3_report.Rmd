# **Rebrickable. Data Exploration**

[_Rebrickable_](https://rebrickable.com/) has been so kind as to provide us with data on their inventories and all related attributes (available [here](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/)). So we decided to take some time to practice our visualization skills on real data (as well as maybe find interesting patterns in the data)

## History of Rebrickable with your own eyes

_Rebrickable_ is a company, therefore we would expect it to grow with time (assuming it is successful). But does the data confirm this? Even though we don't have numbers on the revenue of this company :(, we can at least see how many sets were put out with time: 

```{r historical, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
years_set_amnts = sets %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n=n(), med_num_parts=median(num_parts))

years_set_amnts$num_parts_cat = 
  cut(years_set_amnts$med_num_parts, breaks=c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, +Inf))

histbar = ggplot(years_set_amnts, aes(x=year, y=n, fill=factor(num_parts_cat))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="#000000", size=0.3) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="YlGnBu") + 
  stat_smooth(formula=y~x, fill=NA, alpha=0.3, linewidth=1.3) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 1250), expand=c(0,0)) +
  labs(fill="Median number \nof parts in set",
       title="Number of new sets by year",
       y="Number of sets") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, face="italic"))
ggplotly(histbar)
```
*(plot is interactive, so feel free to inspect the data at your leisure)*

As we can see, the growth in the number of released sets has been almost exponential through the years. (One possibility, however, is that many of the new sets each year are just "updated" versions of older sets - and the possibility of "update"s accumulate with years) <br />Up until about 1980 the median number of parts in sets has been quite volatile, but after that has been predominantly in the range of **`(20, 40]`**

## *Rebrickable* doesn't see <span style="color: purple;">color</span>

Of course, sets are built out of parts. Luckily, *Rebrickable* divides parts into neat categories according to their use. And we wanted to check whether resources are being unnecessarily spent on diversifying colors.

```{r color_counts, echo=FALSE}
categ_color_cnts = invent_parts %>%
  inner_join(parts, by="part_num") %>%
  group_by(part_cat_id) %>%
  summarize(color_cnt=n_distinct(color_id)) %>%
  inner_join(part_categs, by=join_by(part_cat_id == id)) %>%
  arrange(color_cnt)

n_best = 10
n_total = nrow(categ_color_cnts)

splitcat = rep("middle", n_total)

splitcat[1:n_best] = rep(paste("Worst", n_best), n_best)
splitcat[(n_total-n_best+1):n_total] = rep(paste("Best", n_best), n_best)
categ_color_cnts$splitcat = splitcat
categ_color_cnts = categ_color_cnts %>%
  filter(splitcat != "middle")

bar_colors = rep(c("#225ea8", "#41b6c4"), length.out=nrow(categ_color_cnts))

categs_plot = ggplot(categ_color_cnts, aes(x=factor(name, levels=name), y=color_cnt)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill=bar_colors) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 120), expand=c(0, 0)) +
  facet_grid(splitcat ~ ., scales="free") +
  labs(y="Number of available colors",
       x="Category",
       title="Available colors for each category") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, face="italic"))
categs_plot
```

Unfortunately, we see that the distribution is quite logical:

* Parts which are more likely to be on the outer surface - have **larger** varieties of color (e.g. `Minifig Accessories`, `Bricks`, ...)
* Parts which are more likely to be on the inside or parts of mechanisms - have **smaller** varietes of color (e.g. `Pneumatics`, `Mechanical`, ...)

## Top 10 Hot Themes in Your Area!! <3

Millions of people around the world build sets specifically because of the theme (perhaps their favorite show or movie). So we decided to see which themes have been most abundant in the inventories of *Rebrickable* and when did they first appear!

```{r hot_themes, echo=FALSE}
themes_first_years = sets %>%
  group_by(theme_id) %>%
  summarize(first_year=min(year))

themes_quants = invent_sets %>%
  inner_join(sets, by="set_num") %>%
  group_by(theme_id) %>%
  summarize(tot_quant=sum(quantity)) %>%
  top_n(10, tot_quant)

theme_avg_parts = sets %>%
  group_by(theme_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_parts=mean(num_parts))

thm_quants_fyears = themes_first_years %>%
  inner_join(themes_quants, by="theme_id") %>%
  inner_join(theme_avg_parts, by="theme_id") %>%
  inner_join(themes, by=join_by(theme_id == id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_parts))

colors = c("#081d58", "#253494", "#225ea8", "#1d91c0", "#41b6c4",
           "#7fcdbb", "#c7e9b4", "#edf8b1", "#ffffd9", "#ffffff")
vjusts = c(3.6, 4, 3.3, 3, 3, 2, -2.5, 1.7, 1, -2)
hjusts= c(-0.2, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
scat = ggplot(thm_quants_fyears, aes(x=first_year, y=tot_quant,label=name)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=avg_parts), fill=colors, color="black", shape=21, alpha=0.7) +
  scale_size(name="Size", range=c(5, 35)) +
  geom_point(size=1.5, color="black") +
  geom_text(size=4, color="#525252", hjust=hjusts, vjust=-vjusts) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1980, 2025)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0.1, 0.1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="none", 
        plot.title=element_text(size=15, hjust=0.5, face="italic"),
        plot.subtitle=element_text(color="#525252"),
        axis.ticks.x=element_line()) +
  labs(x="Year of First Introduction",
       y="Total Quantity in Inventories",
       title="Top 10 Themes of Sets",
       subtitle="(size indicates average number of parts in set)")
scat
```

```{r themes_table, echo=FALSE}
out_themes_quants = thm_quants_fyears %>%
  select(name, avg_parts, first_year) %>%
  rename(Theme=name, Avg_Num_Parts=avg_parts, Year_Introduced=first_year)

kable(out_themes_quants)
```

*(The table was introduced due to plotly not cooperating well with the plot above)*
